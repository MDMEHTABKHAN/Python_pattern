# Introduction <br>
This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate various pattern programs. Pattern programming is often used to teach the fundamentals of loops and conditionals in programming languages. The patterns range from simple triangles and pyramids to more complex shapes. These programs are a great way to practice control flow and learn how to manipulate output in a structured format.
